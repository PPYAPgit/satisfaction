Bless you, my dear

## How to edit
We should use *satisfaction-git* directory.

After edit, use
`git add`, then changed files will be tracked. (We can see this by `git status`)
`git commit -m "<description>"`, then tracked files will be committed.
`git push origin master`, then committed files will be saved in the master branch. (which is online.)

After push, go to server and
`git pull origin master`, then files in server will be updated.
